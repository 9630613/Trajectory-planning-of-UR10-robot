# Geometric jacobian
In order to calculate the jacobian matrix, fist of all, the transformation matrix should be made. The following matrix called transformation matrix includes the rotation matrix(   $A_i^{i-1}(q_i) [1:3,1:3]$   ) and the position matrix (   $A_i^{i-1}(q_i) [1:3,4]$   ) that are with respect to their previous joints.


 $$A_i^{i-1}(q_i) =A_i^{i-1}\begin{pmatrix}\alpha_i\\
\theta_i\\
d_i\\
a_i
\end{pmatrix}= A_{i'}^{i-1} A_i^{i'}= \begin{bmatrix}c_{\theta_i} & -s_{\theta_i}c_{\alpha_i} & s_{\theta_i}s_{\alpha_i} & a_ic_{\theta_i}\\
s_{\theta_i} & c_{\theta_i}c_{\alpha_i} & -c_{\theta_i}s_{\alpha_i} & a_is_{\theta_i}\\
0 & s_{\alpha_i} & c_{\alpha_i} & d_i\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}$$



According to   $A_i^{i-1}(q_i)$   , the transformation matrix could be calculated. For example, for the first joint is :


$$A_{10}=A_1^{0}\begin{pmatrix}\alpha_1\\
\theta_1\\
d_1\\
a_1
\end{pmatrix} =A_1^{0}\begin{pmatrix} q_1\\
\frac{-Pi}{2}\\
0.1273\\
0
\end{pmatrix}= \begin{bmatrix}c(\frac{-Pi}{2}) & -s(\frac{-Pi}{2})c(q_1) & s(\frac{-Pi}{2})s(q_1) & 0 c(\frac{-Pi}{2})\\
s(\frac{-Pi}{2}) & c(\frac{-Pi}{2})c(q_1) & -c(\frac{-Pi}{2})s(q_1) & 0 s(\frac{-Pi}{2})\\
0 & s(q_1) & c(q_1) & 0.1273\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}$$


Other joints are calculated as the same.



$$ A_{21}=A_2^{1}\begin{pmatrix} q_2\\
0\\
0\\
-0.612
\end{pmatrix}$$


$$A_{32}=A_3^{2}\begin{pmatrix} q_3\\
0\\
0\\
-0.5723
\end{pmatrix}$$

$$A_{43}=A_4^{3}\begin{pmatrix} q_4\\
\frac{Pi}{2}\\
0.163941\\
0
\end{pmatrix}$$

$$A_{54}=A_5^{4}\begin{pmatrix} q_5\\
\frac{-Pi}{2}\\
0.1157\\
0
\end{pmatrix}$$

$$A_{65}=A_6^{5}\begin{pmatrix} q_6\\
0\\
0.0922\\
0
\end{pmatrix}$$




Now, by multiplying each matrix by its all privious ones, the trnsformation matrix of each joint with respect to the base could be produced.



$A_{20} = A_{10} A_{21}$



$A_{30} = A_{10} A_{21} A_{32}$



$A_{40} = A_{10} A_{21} A_{32} A_{43}$



$A_{50} = A_{10} A_{21} A_{32} A_{43}*A_{54}$



$A_{60} = A_{10} A_{21} A_{32} A_{43} A_{54} A_{65}$



Afterwards, the position matrix of the last joint(6th) with respect to other joints is produced like:

$P_{60} = A_{60}[1:3,4]$


$P_{61} = A_{60}[1:3,4]-A_{10}[1:3,4]$


$P_{62} = A_{60}[1:3,4]-A_{20}[1:3,4]$


$P_{63} = A_{60}[1:3,4]-A_{30}[1:3,4]$


$P_{64} = A_{60}[1:3,4]-A_{40}[1:3,4]$


$P_{65} = A_{60}[1:3,4]-A_{50}[1:3,4]$


Now, we should find the position matrix of each joint with respect to the base, that easily could be calculate:


$$Z_0=\begin{bmatrix} 0\\
0\\
1
\end{bmatrix}$$


$Z_1=A_{10}[1:3,4]$

$Z_2=A_{20}[1:3,4]$

$Z_3=A_{30}[1:3,4]$

$Z_4=A_{40}[1:3,4]$

$Z_5=A_{50}[1:3,4]$

Finally, this is ready to replace the elements in jacobian equasion.


$$J=\begin{bmatrix} Z_0 \times P_{60} & Z_1 \times P_{61} & Z_2 \times P_{62} & Z_3 \times P_{63} & Z_4 \times P_{64} & Z_5 \times P_{65} \\
 Z_0 &  Z_1 &  Z_2 & Z_3 &  Z_4 & Z_5
\end{bmatrix}$$


# Analytic jacobian
In order to calculate the inverse kinematic, it is necessary to use the analytic jacobian which needs the euler angles. The xyz coordinate is used for euler angles because of the VREP coordinate. 
In fact, the only difference between geometric jacobian and analytic jacobian is their angular velocities, whereas they have the same linier velocities, so to calculate the analytic jacobian, the geometric angular velocities should be changed. 
The angular velocities in the geometric jacobian are the derivative of euler angles at every moment.Then, for the (xyz)coordinate :

$$ T_{xyz}\begin{pmatrix} \alpha\\
\theta\\
 \gamma
\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1& 0 & \sin\theta\\
0& \cos\alpha & -\cos\theta \sin\alpha\\
0& \sin\alpha & \cos\theta \cos\alpha
\end{pmatrix} $$



$$	w= T(\Phi) \Phi'$$

The α, $\theta$, and γ are the euler angles calculated by solving the inverse problem of the rotation matrix of 6th joint with respect to the base at every moment.
In order to caculate the rotation matrix, the elementary rotation matrixes should be multiplied in sequence, $R_x(α), R_y(\theta), R_z(γ)$, and the inverse problem should be solved at the moment. To Solve the problem, the next function is used.

````c++
rotm2eul(R60,’xyz’)
````
As the result, the euler angles are replaced to make T.
Finally, by multiplying T inverse in the angular velocities of geometric jacobian, the analytic one is produced.
Duo to the fact that T should be a $6\times 6$ matrix to be able to be multiplied by U, the extra matrixes $0_{3 \times 3}$ and $I_{3 \times 3}$ (indentity matrix) are added in the nutral positions .

$$ U=\begin{bmatrix} I_{3 \times 3} & 0_{3 \times 3}\\
0_{3 \times 3} & T_{3 \times 3}
\end{bmatrix}$$


$$ J_G=U J_A$$


$$ J_A=\begin{bmatrix} I&0\\
0&T
\end{bmatrix}^{-1}*J_G$$

# Trajectory planning 
To solve the trajectory planning, a linear cartesian path is planned in the 6 dimension task space including position and orientation. Also, a trapezoidal velocity profile is used in timing law to have a constant velocity along the path . 
Now, the initial and final position and orientation should be found.  
The position is calculated by replacing the qi and qf in the end-effector position with respect to the base. The end-effector position is the 4th column in 6th joint of the transformation matrix with respect to the base. thus 
````c++
xi= subs(p60,{q1,q2,q3,q4,q5,q6},{pi/2,0,pi/2,0,pi/2,pi/6}) 
xf= subs(p60,{q1,q2,q3,q4,q5,q6},{pi/4,-pi/4,pi/1.5,0,pi/2,0})
````


$$x_i=\begin{pmatrix} −0.1639\\
 −0.4963\\
0.7918
\end{pmatrix}              q_i=\begin{pmatrix} −0.4645\\
−0.2327 \\
0.3664
\end{pmatrix}$$


The needed orientation is calculated by replacing qi in the rotation matrix of the 6th joint with respect to the base, and finding the euler angles. It is noticable that the final orientation is the same, according to the given data of the issue (constant orientation along the path).
````c++
Rotation matrix=subs(A60(1:3,1:3),{q1,q2,q3,q4,q5,q6},{pi/2,0,pi/2,0,pi/2,pi/6})
Euler angles= rotm2eul (Rotation matrix,’xyz’)
````
Finally, the initial and final position:


$$x_i=\begin{pmatrix} −0.1639\\
 −0.4963\\
0.7918\\
0\\
0\\
−2.6118
\end{pmatrix}              x_f=\begin{pmatrix} −0.4645\\
−0.2327 \\
0.3664\\
0\\
0\\
−2.6118
\end{pmatrix}$$
	
Now, making the trajectory:


$L= ||x_f-x_i||= 0.58m$

$T=7 sec (given)$

$V_{max} =0.1 m/s(consider)$

$T_s= \frac{(T- L)}{V_{max}}$

$a_{max}=\frac{V_{max}}{T_s}$


$$Ϭ=\begin{array}{ccc} 
\frac{a_{𝑚𝑎𝑥}𝑡^2}{2}                          & 	  t \to [0,T_s]\\
v_{𝑚𝑎𝑥}𝑡 − \frac{{v_{𝑚𝑎𝑥}}^2}{2a_{𝑚𝑎𝑥}}                            &    t \to  [T_s,T-T_s]\\
\frac{-𝑎_{𝑚𝑎𝑥}( 𝑡 − 𝑇)^2}{2} + v_{𝑚𝑎𝑥}T+\frac{{v_{𝑚𝑎𝑥}}^2}{a_{𝑚𝑎𝑥}}&        t \to [T-T_s,T]
\end{array}$$
 
 
This timing low will be constant for every desired path with trapezoidal velocity profile, and the difference is in making the path parameterization. The path is linear,so:

$S=\frac{Ϭ}{L}$

$X_{des} = x_i +S(x_f - x_i)$

$d_{X_des}=S(x_f - x_i)$

# Inverse kinematics 
Controling the robot is with joint configuration, so q matrix That is the joint configuration at every moment is given.  
$$𝑞′ = 𝐽_{𝐴−1}(𝑞) $$
With integrating from drivative of q, the joint configuration (q) is produced, but there is a problem when a joint is in singularity. As the result, the jacobian loses its rank and we can’t control the robot. That will stops the robot from working or moves it undesirably. thus, the Damped last squares method is introduced.
$$𝐽^* = 𝐽^T(𝐽 𝐽^T + {𝛾^2}I)^{-1}$$
Now with using a suitable γ , we can control robot in the singularities.
	            	
# Controlling the robot
In order to control the robot on the desired path, an error is calculated between the desired task and the actual end_effector position and orientation. 
The error is :                 

$$ 𝑒 = 𝑥_{𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑖𝑟𝑒𝑑} − 𝑥_{endeffector} $$

The end-effector position is a 6 by 1 matrix including the position of the 6th joint and euler angles at every moment. Finally:  


$$ 𝑑_𝑞 = 𝐽^T(𝐽 𝐽^T + 𝛾^2{I})^{−1}(𝑑𝑥_{𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑖𝑟𝑒𝑑} − 𝑘 𝐼(𝑥_{𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑖𝑟𝑒𝑑} − 𝑥_{endeffector})) $$

# V-REP 

V-REP (the Virtual Robot Experimentation Platform) is a 3D robot simulation software, with integrated development environment, that allows you to model, edit, program and simulate any robot or robotic system (e.g. sensors, mechanisms, etc.).
Although some brief information on setting the robot is provided below, you could find more information on [v-rep (CoppeliaSim) matlab client , and animation of robot joints (legacyRemoteApi)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z01cRw_i5E).


For connectioning to V-rep, 4 files from V-REP installation directory and a MATLAB file should be altogether pased in a new folder.  

<img src="https://github.com/9630613/Trajectory-planning-of-UR10-robot/blob/main/Images/vrep_1.PNG" width= "500">

In MATLAB, some codes should be copied and writen. These codes introduce the joints to V-rep. Furthermore, there is a loop that sends the angular configuration to the robot joints in V-REP simultaneously because the robot is controlled by joint configuration.  

<img src="https://github.com/9630613/Trajectory-planning-of-UR10-robot/blob/main/Images/vrep_2.PNG" width= "700">

In V-REP, the robot should be chosen and replaced its code with ````simRemoteApi.start(19999)```` for connectiong to MATLAB.

<img src="https://github.com/9630613/Trajectory-planning-of-UR10-robot/blob/main/Images/vrep_3.PNG" width= "500">

Afterwards, the joints should be on the inverse kinematic mood, and the robot motores should be off.    
The important thing in V-REP is calibrating the joint configurations. As the Dinavit diagram, in VREP, is different, so we should calibrate the joints to follow the correct path.   



Finally, the robot is ready to move.

# Results
In the next picture, the error between the desired task and the actual end_effector position and orientation is demostrated in which the error is in order of $10^{15}$ that is concidered acceptable.

Another diagram illustrates the desired thrajectory from the initial position to the final. That, compared with the real trajectory, is accurate.

$$x_i=\begin{pmatrix} −0.1639\\
 −0.4963\\
0.7918\\
0\\
0\\
−2.6118
\end{pmatrix}              x_f=\begin{pmatrix} −0.4645\\
−0.2327 \\
0.3664\\
0\\
0\\
−2.6118
\end{pmatrix}$$

<img src="https://github.com/9630613/Trajectory-planning-of-UR10-robot/blob/main/Images/desired%20trajectory.jpg" width= "500">

The last one shows the joint configurations in Radian. that, according to the given final position, the result is precise.

$$q_i=\begin{pmatrix} \frac{Pi}{2}\\
0\\
\frac{Pi}{2}\\
0\\
\frac{Pi}{2}\\
\frac{Pi}{6}
\end{pmatrix}              q_f=\begin{pmatrix} \frac{Pi}{4}\\
\frac{-Pi}{4}\\
\frac{Pi}{1.5}\\
0\\
\frac{Pi}{2}\\
0
\end{pmatrix}$$

<img src="https://github.com/9630613/Trajectory-planning-of-UR10-robot/blob/main/Images/4the%20joint%20configuration.jpg" width= "500">

By comparing initial and final joint configurations and desired trajectory, a very small difference is absorbed because the error is negligibile. 

# Conclusion
Controlling robot in this given path needs a strong controller due to the singularities. Also, the robot, during the path, had a limit velocity around 0.1 m/sec.


What is more, robot crashed into the ground because not only the task space has 6 DOF (the 3D space) but also UR10 is a 6 DOF robot. As the result, the robot just could move on every particular path with the individual position and joint configuration. In other words, the UR10 is not able to follow one path with 2 different positions. To solve this problem we could deploy another 7 DOF robot like FrankaEmikaPanda. In fact, the redundancy in this robot allows it to move more diverse.

Overall, the robot is controlled properly on the desired path with the least error.
